This is my school project. It's a booking app, that uses TripAdvisors API for searching and displaying available hotels for desired location.
I was unable to obtain free TripAdvisor's API Key, so I'm using the API through a third party (RapidAPI). 
User details and reservations are stored to a local SQLite DB, for demonstration purposes.
